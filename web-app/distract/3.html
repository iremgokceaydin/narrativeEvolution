<p>Before you retell the story, please answer the following short question:</p>

<p>"Aldwych tube station is a closed station on the London Underground, in the City of
    Westminster in central London. The station building, near the junction of Strand and
    Surrey Street, opened in 1907 as the only other station on the Piccadilly line's short
    branch from Holborn. Suffering from low passenger numbers, the station and branch were
    considered for closure several times. Service was offered only during weekday peak
    hours from 1962 and finally discontinued altogether in 1994, when the cost of replacing
    the lifts was considered too high compared to the income generated. Disused parts of
    the station and the running tunnels were used to shelter artworks from the National
    Gallery during the First World War, and from the British Museum during the Second
    World War.‚Äù  (Wikipedia, on the Aldwych tube station)
