    "story": "As a young boy, Jake loved to read, to wander fantastic worlds written in words. Perhaps because of his preoccupation with reading, Jake was also terribly afraid of the dark, within which an unknown, indistinct evil lurked. But he was a young boy, and young boys are often afraid of the dark.\nAs he got older, Jake saw his brother and friends outgrow their fears, while his only became more intense. He wished he could be more like his friends; he longed to go camping, or to sneak out and enjoy the summer nights. But there in the shadows, eerie and ominous shapes writhed and twisted. He buried himself in his books and slept with his lights on.\nOn his sixteenth birthday, Jake had had enough. He gave up reading, turned off his light in the evening, and filled his mind with the pre-occupations of normal teenage boys. It was hard at first, but over time his comfort with the darkness grew. He finally got to go camping, to watch a movie, and even go on a first date. For the first time in his life he was content.\nLate one night, sleeping peacefully, something stirred in the dark corner of his room. In his peaceful slumber, Jake did not hear the scraping of claws on the floor, or feel the steamy breath on his neck, or detect the distinct odor of decaying flesh. Indeed, he didn't even manage a scream before the beast ripped out his throat.",

      "probe": "The lacrimal glands are paired almond-shaped glands, one for each eye, that secrete the aqueous layer of the tear film. They are situated in the upper, outer portion of each orbit, in the lacrimal fossa of the orbit formed by the frontal bone. Inflammation of the lacrimal glands is called dacryoadenitis. The lacrimal gland produces tears which then flow into canals that lead to the lacrimal sac. From this sac, the tears drain through the lacrimal duct into the nose.Anatomists divide the gland into two sections. The smaller palpebral portion lies close to the eye, along the inner surface of the eyelid; if the upper eyelid is everted, the palpebral portion can be seen. The orbital portion contains fine interlobular ducts that unite to form 3–5 main excretory ducts, joining 5–7 ducts in the palpebral portion before the secreted fluid may enter on the surface of the eye. Tears secreted collect in the fornix conjunctiva of the upper lid, and pass over the eye surface to the lacrimal puncta, small holes found at the inner corner of the eyelids. These pass the tears through the lacrimal canaliculi on to the lacrimal sac, in turn to the nasolacrimal duct, which dumps them out into the nose.",

    "title": "Wolf and Dog",
    "story": "A gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he happened to meet a House-dog who was passing by. 'Ah, Cousin,' said the Dog. 'I knew how it would be; your irregular life will soon be the ruin of you. Why do you not work steadily as I do, and get your food regularly given to you?'\n'I would have no objection,' said the Wolf, 'if I could only get a place.'\n'I will easily arrange that for you,' said the Dog; 'come with me to my master and you shall share my work.' So the Wolf and the Dog went towards the town together. On the way there the Wolf noticed that the hair on a certain part of the Dog’s neck was very much worn away, so he asked him how that had come about.\n'Oh, it is nothing,' said the Dog. 'That is only the place where the collar is put on at night to keep me chained up; it chafes a bit, but one soon gets used to it.' 'Is that all?' said the Wolf. 'Then good-bye to you, Master Dog.'\n'Better starve free than be a fat slave.'",

      "probe": "In music, a bow is moved across some part of a musical instrument, causing vibration which the instrument emits as sound. The vast majority of bows are used with string instruments, although some bows are used with musical saws and other bowed idiophones. A bow consists of a specially shaped stick with other material forming a ribbon stretched between its ends, which is used to stroke the string and create sound. Different musical cultures have adopted various designs for the bow. For instance, in some bows a single cord is stretched between the ends of the stick. In the Western tradition of bow making—bows for the instruments of the violin and viol families—a hank of horsehair is normally employed. The manufacture of bows is considered a demanding craft, and well-made bows command high prices. Part of the bow maker's skill is the ability to choose high quality material for the stick. Historically, Western bows have been made of pernambuco wood from Brazil. However, pernambuco is now an endangered species whose export is regulated by international treaty, so makers are currently adopting other materials: woods such as Ipê (Tabebuia) as well as synthetic materials. These synthetic materials include carbon fiber epoxy composite and fiberglass. Carbon fiber bows have become very popular, and some of the better carbon fiber bows are now comparable to fine pernambuco sticks.",

    "title": "A farmer and his son",
    "story": "A farmer got so old that he couldn’t work the fields anymore. So he would spend the day just sitting on the porch. His son, still working the farm, would look up from time to time and see his father sitting there.\n'He’s of no use any more,' the son thought to himself, 'he doesn’t do anything!' One day the son got so frustrated by this, that he built a wood coffin, dragged it over to the porch, and told his father to get in.\nWithout saying anything, the father climbed inside. After closing the lid, the son dragged the coffin to the edge of the farm where there was a high cliff.\nAs he approached the drop, he heard a light tapping on the lid from inside the coffin. He opened it up. Still lying there peacefully, the father looked up at his son. 'I know you are going to throw me over the cliff, but before you do, may I suggest something?' 'What is it?' replied the son. 'Throw me over the cliff, if you like,' said the father, 'but save this good wood coffin. Your children might need to use it.'",

      "probe": "Old-school hip hop (also spelled 'old skool') describes the earliest commercially recorded hip hop music (approximately 1979–1984),and the music in the period preceding it from which it was directly descended. Old school hip hop is said to have ended around 1984 due to changes in both rapping technique and the accompanying music and rhythms. Old-school hip hop is noted for its relatively simple rapping techniques compared to later hip-hop music. Artists such as Melle Mel would use few syllables per bar of music, with simple rhythms and a moderate tempo. Much of the subject matter of old school hip hop centers around partying and having a good time. In the book 'How to Rap', Immortal Technique explains how party content played a big part in old school hip hop: 'hip-hop was born in an era of social turmoil... in the same way that slaves used to sing songs on a plantation... that's the party songs that we used to have'. As mentioned earlier, a notable exception is the song 'The Message', which was written by Melle Mel for his hip hop group, Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five; the song was a hit and introduced social commentary to hip hop.",

    "title": "Electricity",
    "story": "Electricity is a force caused by electric charge. It is a form of energy which we use to power machines and electrical devices. When the charges are not moving, electricity is called static electricity. When the charges are moving they are an electric current, sometimes called 'dynamic electricity'. Electricity works because electric charges push and pull on each other. There are two types of electric charges: positive charges and negative charges. Similar charges repel each other. This means that if you put two positive charges close together and let them go, they would move apart. Two negative charges also repel. But different charges attract each other. This means that if you put a positive charge and a negative charge close together, they would smack together. A short way to remember this is the phrase opposites attract, likes repel.\nElectric charges push or pull on each other if they are not touching. This is possible because each charge makes an electric field around itself. An electric field is an area that surrounds a charge. At each point near a charge, the electric field points in a certain direction. If a positive charge is put at that point, it will be pushed in that direction. If a negative charge is put at that point, it will be pushed in the exact opposite direction.",

      "probe": "Manga are comics created in Japan, or by Japanese creators in the Japanese language, conforming to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century. They have a long and complex pre-history in earlier Japanese art. In Japan, people of all ages read manga. The medium includes works in a broad range of genres: action-adventure, romance, sports and games, historical drama, comedy, science fiction and fantasy, mystery, suspense, detective, horror, sexuality, and business/commerce, among others. Although this form of entertainment originated in Japan, many manga are translated into other languages, mainly English. Since the 1950s, manga has steadily become a major part of the Japanese publishing industry, representing a ¥406 billion market in Japan in 2007 (approximately $3.6 billion) and ¥420 billion ($5.5 billion) in 2009.  Manga have also gained a significant worldwide audience. In Europe and the Middle East the market is worth $250 million. In 2008, in the U.S. and Canada, the manga market was valued at $175 million. The markets in France and the United States are about the same size. Manga stories are typically printed in black-and-white, although some full-color manga exist. In Japan, manga are usually serialized in large manga magazines, often containing many stories, each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue. If the series is successful, collected chapters may be republished in tankōbon volumes, frequently but not exclusively, paperback books. A manga artist (mangaka in Japanese) typically works with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative editor from a commercial publishing company. If a manga series is popular enough, it may be animated after or even during its run. Sometimes manga are drawn centering on previously existing live-action or animated films.",

      "probe": "Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 120 species of mosses, commonly known as peat moss. Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger peatlands, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.",
