Jenny stopped drinking water because of her long hours, and instead drinks coffee to stay awake. Jenny noticed her skin was starting to look bad, and so she went to her dermatologist. Her dermatologist told her to start drinking 64 ounces of water and to start practicing stress relief techniques, like meditation or breathing exercises for 10 minutes daily. She also learned being well hydrated can help with her feelings of tiredness, and would improve her skin tone and texture. By exercising, practicing stress relief and hydrating enough, Jenny started sleeping better, which helped improve her skin problems. The combination of stress relief, hydration, and stress relief also had benefits for Jenny’s mental health.",

Even if they believe they have healthy eating habit and have regular check-ups, their sedentary lifestyle may put them at risk for osteoporosis. They visit a doctor, when they have a small physical impact on their body. The doctor may ask about recent daily routines as their usual procedure, but may suggest taking a x-ray. Then the doctor may diagnose them with osteoporosis. They may realize that not doing unhealthy behavior is not enough to keep their health, and their lifestyle needs to be changed. They decided to add more physical activities in their daily life. They also start to take dietary supplement that prevent osteoporosis.",
